# notesapp

Using Firebase and Flutter, I managed to build a notes application that could generate, read, update, and remove data over Firestore. Learning how to make, update, delete, and read notes was possible for me. It refreshes the firebase automatically. This was my first opportunity to learn Firebase with Cloud Firestore.
